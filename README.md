Blitting OpenFL
===============

## Introduction

Blitting OpenFL is a rendering engine and lifecycle pipeline, distributed as a haxelib.

Focused in bit blit (bit-boundary block transfer), Blitting leverages performance oriented design
for graphics, bitmap, and 3D rendering.  Through a core engine, pipelines optimize rendering, layout, and invalidation lifecycles.

Blitting OpenFL is an [OpenFL](http://www.openfl.org/) port to the [Haxe](http://haxe.org/) programming language
of the [Blitting](https://github.com/jasonsturges/blitting) ActionScript library.  ActionScript developers should use Blitting.
